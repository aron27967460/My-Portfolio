    <h1 class="col-1of1"><strong>experience</strong></h1>
    <div class="col-1of1">
        <p>I first joined Daylight during the peak time of Covid, then continued to serve as a fully remote member post-Covid. Despite the distance, I remained an active contributor to various projects. Being my first time working for design consultancy, I wanted to share a few traits that enabled my success:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-1of1">
        <h2 class="dblue">EMPATHIZE WITH PEOPLE</h2>
        <p>Successful designs excel at being human-centered. At Daylight, this is the foundational principle for every project—whether it involves recruiting the right participants for research, conducting immersive home visits, or performing ad-hoc user testing. We always find creative ways to empathize with the people we’re designing for. In many of my projects, I helped define recruiting profiles, facilitate user interviews, synthesize raw insights into actionable opportunities, ideate relevant concepts, and polish them into development-ready designs (primarily UI design, with some physical elements).</p>

        <p>During my project with SL Corporation, the client aimed to understand the market needs in China. To discover the most genuine insight, our team devised an extensive research process in Shanghai that included studying Chinese EV brands, conducting in-home visits with targeted customers, attending inspirational outings, and consulting relevant experts. As a team, we took human-centered design to heart.</p>

          <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder" style="width:100%;height:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="col-1of1 bottomnote">
          Some research artifact from the SL project.
        </div>

        <p class="top-margin-2">Another example When we worked with Santa Clara County Housing Authority (SCCHA), given its government agency nature, it was vital for us to understanding their administrative flow. We spent the time to talk to various housing program specialist and housing assistants and studied their operating manual to map out each of the process. Once we generated the flow chart, we then created UI flows using the design system we prepared specifically for the experience. The result was a digital experience that can significantly streamline their process and reduce burnout from these specialists.</p>

        <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-4">
          <div class="col-2of3 container center">
            <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
          </div>
          <div class="col-1of3">
            <p class="sidenote-noborder">Placeholder text</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="top-margin-2">One crucial aspect of working as a consultant is empathizing with clients, who are also vital to the project’s success. Understanding their needs, building rapport and trust can be essential for teamwork and project success. For example, In one of our research project, we decided to opt for a private chef lesson as a way to look for inspiration but also to involve our client to be part of our team. This helped us to create a union and enabled us to collaborate much more smoothly.

          <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" style="width:100%;height:100%">

        <div class="col-1of1 bottomnote">

        </div>
    </div>

      <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-3">
        <h2 class="dblue">ALWAYS READY TO GO</h2>
        <p>Working in a consulting environment requires great adaptability to chaos and changes. It’s nearly impossible to have an ideal scenario—one project after another—because things rarely go according to plan. One of my greatest strengths is my readiness to contribute and perform in different roles at various stages of the project. As an individual contributor, I often served as a reinforcement for other project teams for additional output or take on shifting roles as needed.</p>

        <p>From the projects we had with Ford, I was pulled in during user testing phase to create concepts using the Ford design system. With limited time and knowledge, I created deliverables that sufficiently met our standard and purposes for the projects.</p>
        <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-4">
          <div class="col-2of3 container center">
            <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="placeholder" width="100%">
          </div>
          <div class="col-1of3">
            <p class="sidenote-noborder">Placeholder text</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="top-margin-4">Another instance, during a project with LG Electronics, due to internal resource conflicts, I had to transition from individual contributor to project and client manager. I coordinated with the client and managed the project timeline while remaining a solid part-time contributor. This project resulted in multiple follow-up projects with the client.</p>
        <div class="col-1of1 top-margin-4">
          <img src="images/placeholder.jpg" alt="Placeholder" style="width:100%;height:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="col-1of1 bottomnote">
          Find some artifact to show, email, work schedule, etc.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-3">
        <h2 class="dblue">QUICK ADOPTER</h2>
        <p>One of the most fascinating things I love working as consultant is that we get to work with clients from all kinds of background. With people from various industries, learnability becomes an essential for our success. Typically at the beginning of a new project, we will have one or two weeks to immerse ourselves in the client’s world. This immersion includes not only common industry knowledge but also understanding of their competitors, business models, and part of their internal processes. From the communication tools they use to their design systems, operating systems, and media choices, familiarity is key. </p>

        <p>While working with EarnIn, we needed to understand the concept of Earned Wage Access (EWA), how their app works, and their design system to ideate design concepts that could be feasibly integrated. Despite a rapid schedule of sprints, we were able to deliver innovate designs with high fidelity and precision. Thanks to our craftsmanship, the client was impressed and decided to extend our contract continue our partnership.</p>
