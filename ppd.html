        <h2>POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION</h2>
        <p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder that affects 10-15% of birthing persons during or after pregnancy. Symptoms of PPD include uncontrollable crying, feeling worthless or guilty, and not being able to bond with their baby. For the parents, untreated postpartum depression could potentially develop into chronic or recurrent depression. For their children, it can contribute to emotional, behavioural, cognitive, and interpersonal problems in later life. (Stuart-Parrigon, Stuart, 2016)</p>

      <div class="col-1of1">
        <p>As part of our research, we’d also identified and listed barriers, which may inhibit new, urban, low-income parents from engaging with postpartum depression services. Through team discussions, we then synthesized these barriers into three overarching barriers:</p>

        <h2>LEVERAGING INTERNET AND MOBILE WEBSITES</h2>
        <p>To support new, urban, low-income parents from accessing postpartum services, we studied different mediums and channels that this population may interact with such as social media platforms like Facebook and a dedicated mobile app.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, from our research, we learned that this population has the pre-existing practice to access the internet through their smartphones to search for information regarding health and childcare. We also determined that this occurred over a short burst of time, for 10-15 min per day. For these reasons, we’d decided to not only focus on leveraging the internet but also to have our intervention resides on mobile.

      <div class="col-1of1">
        <p>We looked into existing sources found on mobile regarding postpartum care, and surfaced these key barriers that stopped new, urban, low-income parents from seeking for the information they need:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1of1">
          <ol>
            <li>Information overload on website</li>

          </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="col-1of1">
      <p>This then brought us to ask, how might we facilitate the information-seeking process so that new, urban, low-income parents are better able to find postpartum information in a timely manner?</p>

        <p>With the aim to help supporting new, urban, low-income parents in accessing information regarding postpartum care, we proposed a platform which leverages the Google Knowledge Graph to surface information about postpartum depression from credible sources and connects them to relevant services. Through the use of our intervention, we hope to guide them into seeking and receiving professional help as they may be in need.</p>

        <h2>ENTRY POINT - GOOGLE</h2>
        <p>We decided to use Google as the platform for the intervention since mobile search already happens for our users. This improves the chances of long-term adoption in comparison to a dedicated app and also gives a more seamless entry fitting with their pre-existing practices.</p>

        <p>Google’s Knowledge Graph (a.k.a.

        “During breastfeeding, a parent may experience discomfort, pain or difficulties which may prompt them to seek for information or help.

        <h2>PRODUCT OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>We’d divided our intervention into five distinct stages: Discover, Learn, Assess, Seek, and Save. These stages provide different unique features to fulfill each new, urban, low-income parents’ needs for postpartum care. Moreover, they are also compatible with their pre-existing practices of accessing the internet through smartphones.</p>

        <h2>GOOGLE INDIRECT SEARCH</h2>
        <p>In this scenario, the new parent might not be aware that difficulties breastfeeding, especially any prolonged pain, is a common symptom and precursor to postpartum depression but instead a regular part of being a parent. As such, they may be googling for postnatal care indirectly. Also, recognizing the fact that our design couldn’t automatically assume that a parent is experiencing postpartum depression, we developed a more subtle way of integrating information about postpartum depression in the “other health conditions” and “people also ask” sections. Clicking on postpartum depression will bring them to our next stage.</p>

        <h2>KNOW YOUR RISK WITH EPDS</h2>
        <p>Mental health screening tools can help raise awareness and support seeking help earlier. But because our target population may not be aware of such resources due to systemic barriers, we decided to integrate the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), a 10-item questionnaire widely used by health professionals to screen birthing persons for postpartum depression.</p>

        <p>Our research indicated that for new, urban, low-income families, locating services is the hardest part of getting help, especially if time or money is a concern.

The reason we did this is that our research revealed that our target population uses technology in short bursts; often only 10-15 minutes per day. That being said, the side menu provides an easy way to access “saved” services enabling a sense of continuity so our users can pick up where they left off.</p>

For example, a search for “postpartum services” will display a short list and further allow users to locate and filter services accordingly. Searches for the EPDS will enable users to take the screening questionnaire within the search results immediately.</p>

        <p>As humans and designers, we believe it is our job and mission to design for basic human needs. Mental health illnesses like postpartum depression are one of the most common complications of childbirth that severely impact the quality of life and relationships for a parent. While our design solution does not carry groundbreaking characteristics, it equips new, urban, low-income parents with the tools to access and understand information and resources that support them in coping with postpartum depression.</p>
        <p>The project taught me never to overlook the small details and the importance of copywriting. While my teammates were in charge of most of the content for the prototypes, I witnessed the importance of language and tone in changing people's perception and making the design emphatic. For instance, one of the most memorable times I had throughout the project was when our team described the target audience as “birthing parents” throughout the presentation came into realization by the audience as being gender-inclusive. That to me was genuinely delightful since I discovered how easily these small details can impact our experience.</p>
