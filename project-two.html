        <p>The CCS Web Redesign provides a donation process for the Canadian Cancer Society that augments the credibility and transparency of their mission to support people living with cancer. It is a warm-up exercise in preparation for the final 10-weeks project in IAT 499 Graduation Project.</p>
        <h2 class="blue">CHALLENGE</h2>
        <p>How might we appeal to the shifting demographics of donors through transparency and credibility, such that we improve Canadian Cancer Society’s revenue?</p>
        <h2 class="blue">ROLE</h2>
        <p>As the UI lead and Interaction designer, I was in charge of creating the majority of the user interfaces. This also enabled me to make critical design decisions regarding the user experience. I also contributed to some of the research that led to our final strategy and product.</p>

      <h2 class="blue">PROBLEM</h2>
      <p>In the last five year, CCS has been on a steady downfall regarding their annual revenue ($204.264M to $149.954M) along with annual giving ($44.156M to $38.428M). This is due to the inability to fulfill the need of a shifting demographic within the new group of potential donors, which results in a situation where <strong class="blue">60% of high priority research has yet to be funded (2016).</strong></p>

      <h2 class="blue">TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
      <p>Through extensive research, our team had dissected CCS’s customer segment into four main categories: the easy givers, the critical supporters, the enthusiasts, and lastly, the non-donors. Out of the four, we decided to focus our product on targeting towards the critical supporters since they represent the emerging demographic of donors and also accounts for easy givers and could potentially transition into enthusiasts over time. </p>

      <h2 class="blue">PROPOSED SOLUTION</h2>
      <p>Through extensive secondary research, our team learned that it is essential to provide regular feedback and update for the donors who nowadays demand transparency and immediate benefit. However, it is often troublesome to give quick return due to the nature of cancer treatment and research which requires a lengthy time investment. So instead of showing results, our team wanted to set a clear donation expectation by telling the donors what exactly will they be investing, such that they could build trust through upfront explicit donation distribution.</p>

      <p>Due to the time constraint and the scope of the project, I decided to focus on creating the landing page, the actual process of donating, and the confirmation of donation.

        <h2 class="blue">LANDING</h2>
        <p>The current CCS doesn’t necessarily have a designated landing page. Instead, it uses one of the sub-pages within their Get Involved segment as their landing page. It uses compelling visual and engaging words to emphasize with the visitors for them to donate to the cause. However, potential donors nowadays seek beyond good faith. They want to attain a clear picture of their investment.</p>
        <p>I had integrated a segment providing an exact breakdown to demonstrate how donor’s donation is distributed. I used slide animation to further emphasize on the section. Although in reality, this is nearly impossible, I believe that people should have the right to know what they are investing.</p>

      <p>To further elevate the transparency aspect, I wanted to design a donation process that is not only efficient but also allows the donors to have an improved knowledge of precisely what they are giving to. That being said, I had made integration into the existing donation process, where donors have the freedom to select the type of cancer and its research they want to fund. This feature enabled a direct relationship between the donors and the high priority research giving the users a sense of need.</p>

    <h1 class="col-1of1" id="final-thought"><strong>FINAL THOUGHT</strong></h1>
    <p>Throughout this project, I was able to learn the importance of transparency and how it can significantly affect the business, both positively and negatively. Whether it’s the customers, the users, or the people, the issue with trust persistently exists for any audience group. That being said, while designing for our project’s interfaces and prototypes, I tried to approach the design with a strong emphasis on transparency building. I focused on making explicit donation distribution more apparent to the donors; allowing them to know the allocation of their investment. While giving absolute freedom and personal privacy, I also utilized other donor's information to provide relevancy and affirm users' donating decisions. In the end, this project taught me that the best business-to-customer relationship forms when the client manages to fulfill the users' needs by offering credibility, empathy, and passion to the people.</p>
