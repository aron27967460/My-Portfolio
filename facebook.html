    <div class="col-1of1">
        <h2 class="fblue">VISION</h2>
        <p>As part of the Search team, our vision was for Facebook Search to be the best experience to find people, communities, and businesses, and to explore the most meaningful content around an interest and what's happening in the world.</p>
        <p>Historically, Facebook has been great at helping users to discover and connect with people, but we had found that many of them are increasingly broadening their search intent into areas such as News, Entertainment, Travel, and Business, which we saw great opportunities to improve.</p>
        <p>Hence, the search team went under a long-term redesign initiative named Apollo. The goal was to provide an intuitive search experience for people to discover content and communities that best suit their interests.</p>
        <h2 class="fblue">MY CORE PROJECT</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of my internship, our team had put together a list of use cases that will help to inform our redesign. For instance, finding an unconnected friend, or find related news about a celebrity and what they are up to. Many of my team members would owner these different use cases.</p>
        <p>My task was to allow these use case owners to build a consistent user experience by<strong> developing a set of universal components and guidelines that help forming the whole page experience for search.</strong> In other words, <strong>a design system dedicated for Search.</strong></p>

        <h2 class="fblue">FOUNDATION TO SEARCH</h2>
        <p>By syncing up with each use case owners as well as PMs, I identified the common patterns across use cases and prioritize components based on their essentiality to the search experience.</p>
        <p>Here are a few of foundational components to the newly Search experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Posts</strong> are a type of core results that allow users to engage with content and communities on Facebook that are relevant to their interest by linking them with post content as well as the entity in the header.</li>
          <li><strong>Entity Result</strong> is a core result component that links directly to an entity destination. It has several variations to accommodate multiple content types.</li>
          <li><strong>Collections</strong> are a component which groups the same entity types into a curated format to help capture user’s intent and enable exploration with people and communities tailored to their interests.</li>
          <li>Finally <strong>Pivots</strong> including Tab Pivot, Product Pivot, Related Searches, and Related Hashtags are components to allow users to transition to more of the same content or other related content.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="col-1of1 top-margin-3">
        <h2 class="fblue">ITERATE, ITERATE, ITERATE</h2>
        <p>The initial search experience was focused on efficiency and compression of information. The redesign aimed to have a content forward experience that allow users to have an improved consumption experience. Along with the adoptation of the existing Facebook Design System, that became the principle guiding me to explore on the components.</p>

          Exploring ways to express components in a content forward way.
        </div>
        <p class="top-margin-4">With one component being used in various content, customization may be required. Therefore, I also took practice to design within context and test out different type of content, which proven to be highly benefitcial in refining the design.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 top-margin-3">
        <h2 class="fblue">DEFINING USAGE</h2>
        <p>Another key part of my project was to define on when and how to use these components I came up with. For instance, what type of collection component do I use. Here are a few points I came up with to consider:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Entity Type</strong> — What is the most essential to this entity type? Does the entity type benefit more with emphasis on images or on snippet information?</li>
          <li><strong>Query Relevance</strong> — What is this collection’s relevance to the query? Is this collection highly relevant (e.g., >80%) to the query, therefore deserve more presence within the search result page? </li>
          <li><strong>Entity Equality</strong> — What’s the entity equality within this collection? Is it important to have each entity’s presence equally distributed within the collection?</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-4">
            <img src="images/FACEBOOK/define component usage.png" alt="Define component usage" width="100%">
        </div>
        <div class="col-1of1 bottomnote">
          1) High relevant query result to people. 2) People rely on both thumbnail and title to discover video, hence a collection to emphasize on both. 3) Less relevant query result to people, hence smaller size component. 4) Similar exposure to the products listed within the collection for fair entity equality.
        </div>

        <p class="top-margin-4">Instead of enforcing designers on the component to use, the goal for these points were to help and inspire them to consider the different use cases and what to prioritize when utilizing these components. There is no absolute right answer.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 top-margin-5">
        <h2 class="fblue">FINAL DELIVERABLES</h2>
        <p>After an extensive collaboration and feedback sessions with all the stakeholders, I created a Post Result page containing a set of component usage and guidelines with a wide range of component variations. This document serves as the source of truth of how the components are constructed and guidelines on how the team could utilize these components.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-4" style="margin-bottom:2em;">
      <p>A huge part of this project's success hinged on collaboration with the design and development team. I needed to understand the needs of each designer for their respective use cases, identify common patterns across all user scenarios, and navigate the technical limitations involved in developing these components. Without collaboration, there was no way I could deliver the result I did.</p>
      <p>The internship not only gave me the experience to work within a large ecosystem, it also taught me how collaboration could create lasting result. Shortly after a few months post the internship, a developer I worked with had informed me that most of the components I created had been implemented and the work I did continued to serve as a helpful source for the team with their work. Hearing that, I was filled with joy and couldn't be more grateful to learn this news. The time may be short, but I was proud to be part of the Search team and a designer that create impact that lasts.</p>
