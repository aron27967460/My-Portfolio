  <!-- INTRO PROJECT -->
  <section class="container project-body" id="project-1">
      <h2 class="col-1of1">PROJECT I</h2>
      <h3>Unveiling App Features People Truly Value</h3>
      <p>In one of the early projects, the team was tasked with identifying the UX gaps within our client's mobile app and surfacing unique feature values to improve app retention. The app is a smart home application that allows users to connect to and interact with their home appliances. From analyzing the app's analytics and interviewing appliance owners, we learned that while people initially downloaded the app, they found it neither useful nor easy to use. Many didn't see the value and preferred to simply interact with the physical appliances alone. To address the problem, our team proposed a few redesigns and feature concepts to enhance communication between the app and its users.</p>

      <h2>ADDITIONAL ROLE</h2>
      <p>I originally joined as an individual contributor but eventually assumed an additional role as a project manager due to shifting resources. While being a full participant in ideation and design execution, I also managed the project timeline, conducted user interviews, and led client communications.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="col-1of1">DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
      <p>I recognized early on that collaboration with the client and mapping out the full experience were essential. By doing so, we gained a clear understanding of the app’s architecture and available features. This allowed us to generate ideas that could seamlessly integrate into the existing ecosystem.</p>

          <p class="bottomnote">Original flow map on the app navigation.</p>
      </div>


      <h2 class="col-1of1">SURFACING USEFUL FEATURES — WASHER</h2>
      <p>By speaking with real appliance owners and understanding our client’s app, we delivered a set of feature concepts tailored to individual home appliances. For example, in the case of a washer, we learned that the app offers many downloadable cycles (e.g., Overnight Wash) that could support users’ laundry needs. However, the app’s user experience made accessing these potentially helpful features daunting and often too cumbersome to explore.</p>

      <div class="col-1of1 container image-inbetween-text">

        </div>
        <p class="bottomnote-center">We gathered feedback from our initial testing session with home appliance owners.</p>
      </div>

      <p>To improve affordance, I revamped the device page to feature a simulated dial experience that mirrors the physical device's control. I also simplified the cycle list by prioritizing popular cycles and recommending options based on user routines.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="col-1of1">DEVICE-SPECIFIC ONBOARDING</h2>
      <p>Another major insight we gained was that users had trouble understanding the benefits available exclusively through the mobile app. For instance, an owner with multiple products from the client mentioned, <i>“I have the oven, but I don’t use the app because who needs an app for an oven?”</i> Part of the issue was the lack of an onboarding experience. Therefore, we proposed introducing a series of device-specific onboarding screens when a new device is connected to the app.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 class="col-1of1">USER FEEDBACK</h2>
      <p>To evaluate the proposed UI, I conducted 1-on-1 user testing sessions with appliance owners. We observed participants completing simple tasks, such as selecting a specific wash cycle, and then asked about their preferences and thoughts between the original UI and the newly designed one.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="col-1of1">HOLISTIC DESIGN</h2>
      <p>To ensure feasibility, we incorporated these new designs into a flow map to demonstrate how users would access and navigate them. Additionally, we included feedback collected from our ad-hoc user tests.</p>

      <h2 class="col-1of1">OUTPUT & RESULT</h2>
      <p>Besides the examples above, we developed many other concepts for various appliances. The project led to an improved app experience and increased user retention rates. For Daylight, the successful delivery of the project served as a strong reference, leading to several follow-up business opportunities with the client.</p>

    <!-- CONNECTING PROJECT -->
    <section class="container project-body" id="project-2">
        <h2 class="col-1of1">PROJECT II</h2>
        <h3>Laying the Groundwork for Upgradable Appliances</h3>
        <p>After the initial project success, our client approached us to evaluate their in-app feature update experience in preparation for a new line of upgradable appliances, specifically targeting the NA market. The goal was to ensure customers understood how to install firmware, download upgrades, and access new features for their appliances. Although the project had a shorter timeline, its significance was immense, providing valuable insights into our client’s app and home appliances and connecting us to another major project in the future.</p>

        <p>For this project, our team chose to employ third-party platforms such as UserTesting. We devised a research plan to recruit relevant participants and asked them to perform several tasks using the prototypes we created.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class="col-1of1">DELIVERABLES & IMPACT</h2>
        <p>Upon conducting the test and analyzing recurring patterns, we learned that while the idea of upgrading an existing product has become well established (e.g., Tesla), upgrading home appliances remains a foreign concept. Therefore, we made several UX updates—most notably to copywriting and UI—to improve clarity and enhance the overall experience. With this project, along with other positive outcomes with the client, we were able to expand our partnership and collaborate on larger, more complex projects.</p>

        <p>Partnering again with Daylight, the client sought to add more features feasible for their upgradable appliances. To generate applicable ideas, our team employed hybrid research methods, including card sorting, Zoom interviews, and in-home visits. In addition, we visited our client’s experimental lab to understand the technical limitations and their ongoing explorations.</p>

        <h2 class="col-1of1">DELIVERABLES & IMPACT</h2>
        <p>After the research trip, we conducted multiple synthesis and ideation sessions with the client’s working team. We developed more than 20 concepts grounded in research. For each concept, we provided relevant user insights, accompanied by animated prototypes (where applicable) and detailed UX specifications. Our goal was to ensure the concepts were not only integratable with the existing physical and digital experiences but also genuinely desirable and helpful to appliance owners.</p>

      <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
      <h2 class="col-1of1">MEASURING SUCCESS<h2>
      <p>Even though these are separate projects and confidential, I believe their success is actually determined by similar metrics. While I did not have access to our client's measurement of impact, below are some key metrics I consider essential for evaluating their successes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User Retention Rate:</strong> Percentage of users who return after their first visit to the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Previously Inactive User:</strong> Users who reengage with the app after initially exiting. This is a valuable additional metric to track, indicating that the app manages to regain the interest of previous users.</li>
        <li><strong>App Usage:</strong> Average user time spent and number of interactions within the app. This is a key metric since increased engagement brings more opportunities for the client to directly share new content and features.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Adoption:</strong> Percentage of users engaging with new or optimized features. This metric helps understand users’ feature preferences — a great source of inspiration for the client when developing new features.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="col-1of1">REFLECTION<h2>
      <p>Through these projects, I learned that cross-platform consistency is crucial when designing for multiple platforms (e.g., mobile, appliance UI, etc.). Regardless of where and how users engage with the products, they expect seamless interactions. To ensure this, we worked closely with the client’s development team to understand software and hardware limitations—what sensors these appliances have, what usage data we could leverage, and how the app communicates with the appliances. By combining this knowledge with insights from user research, ideas for improvement naturally emerge.</p>

      <p>Looking back, one thing I would do differently is further diversify participant profiles in our user research. While we delivered strong findings and results, I found it challenging to uncover unique insights by primarily speaking with typical home appliance owners who perform routine household chores. Expanding the participant pool could have helped us identify more edge use cases. For example, a single person living alone in a mansion may approach chores entirely differently from a family of six in a small apartment. The more diverse the participants, the greater the potential for generating innovative ideas. This is essential because clients—often highly experienced in their respective domains—turn to us specifically for out-of-the-box thinking.</p>
