    <h1>Research Process</h1>
    <p>To uncover the most authentic insights, the team devised an extensive research plan in Shanghai, which included studying Chinese EV brands, interviewing customers with unique lighting needs, attending inspirational outings such as TeamLab, and consulting experts from relevant fields. Throughout the process, I assisted with translation and conducted interviews with relevant participants.</p>

        Sample of insight
      </div>
    </div>
    <p class="col-1of1 top-margin-2">Through synthesis workshops, we presented a set of insights with the aim to inspire product direction tailor to the Chinese market for BMW:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The New Heritage of BMW:</strong> For years, people buy into BMW for its long heritage of driving excellence. With the definition of luxury evolved around technology advancement in China, there is a need to redefine BMW’s New Heritage in China, but instead following the Chinese overt tech trend, develop innovative lighting solutions that feel German— humble but precise.</li>
      <li><strong>Pǐn Wèi and BMW:</strong> The Chinese word Pin Wei refers to a subtle, dignified taste for the self. An elevated quality that is admired by others. A concept that is highly regarded within the Chinese region. For lighting, that means experiences that are quietly different from mainstream makes and models. The difference is in the detail; solutions are be made tasteful through subtle and elegant execution. </li>
      <li><strong>Multi-Modal Archetypes:</strong> As a brand that excels at driving experience, BMW has the unique opportunity to cater to all multi-modal (driving vs. chauffeuring) needs and to defy the common saying in Chinese "BMW is better to drive, (Mercedes) Benz is better to ride in." Lighting can serve as the key factor in facilitating these mode transitions.</li>
      <li><strong>Exclusive Connections:</strong> With car clubs being a popular phenomenon in China, BMW can strengthen bonds between BMW owners through lighting interactions that are tailored to these uniquely Chinese car owners clubs.</li>
    </ul>
