  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="container project-body" id="process">
    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>In a world where many UI patterns have become standardized and common, EarnIn’s executives believe in the value of a user experience that is unique and delightful—a lesson learned from their signature “transfer out” feature (see example below). While their internal design team is phenomenal in their own right, EarnIn wanted us to look further outside the box. Building on this belief, for each bi-weekly sprint, our team was given a product area to explore ways to make the overall customer journey more memorable without reducing its usability.</p>

    <h2>APPROACH</h2>
    <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of working as a consultant is the opportunity to collaborate with clients from various industries. This diversity requires us to quickly learn and adapt, but at the same time, we get to leverage our outsider perspective to explore novel ideas and challenge our creative boundaries.</p>

    <p>While working with our client in financial services, we needed to understand the concept of Earned Wage Access (EWA), along with the functionality of their mobile app, design system, and operating ecosystem. Despite a fast-paced sprint schedule, we delivered innovative, high-fidelity designs with precision. We achieved this by leveraging a three-designer team, enabling broad exploration of ideas and deep refinement of promising concepts through rapid prototyping.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="bottomnote-center">To achieve the best results, we often explore a wide range of ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <p>For this project, despite the sprint schedule not being built for user testing, we still managed to conduct internal testing sessions with our colleagues. While they were not real users, these sessions gave us a brief sense of what worked and what didn’t. In addition, we regularly hosted review sessions with our client’s working team—including designers, developers, and researchers—to leverage their experience with EarnIn users.</p>

  <section class="container project-body" id="navigation">
    <h1>Navigation and Explore</h1>
    <p class="col-1of1">As EarnIn continues to grow, more products are destined to come. With the ever-expanding list of features, EarnIn wanted to rethink their navigation and discovery with the goal of creating a simplified yet delightful cross-selling experience.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 container image-inbetween-text">
      <h2>EXPLORATION</h2>
      <p class="col-1of1">Focusing on colors and interaction patterns, I explored a wide range of low-fidelity prototypes. The objective was to explore broadly—no idea was off-limits.</p>

    <h1>Onboarding</h1>
    <p class="col-1of1">While functionality is important, EarnIn believes that a compelling user experience creates a long-lasting relationship with customers. The revamp of the onboarding experience was part of the initiative to make that vision come true.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 container image-inbetween-text">
      <h2>ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN</h2>

    <p>Impressed by the output from all the prior sprints, EarnIn tasked us to explore a long feature they had in mind in helping customer’s financial management experience and help them better manage their finances.

    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p class="col-1of1">From the client, we learned that customers often have a set amount of recurring earnings and expenses that can be projected. Our goal was to visualize this information and show how their live income could cover upcoming expenses due in the next few weeks. We aimed to create an interface that clearly communicates the relationship between these elements and their associated details. Additionally, recognizing that not all bills share the same priority, we introduced an ordering mechanism that allows users to label their bills and see how prioritized bills are covered compared to simply ordering by due dates.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 container image-inbetween-text">
      <div class="col-2of3 center container">
        <img src="../images/DAYLIGHT/earnin-bill-reminder.gif" alt="An overview of the bill reminder" width="250px">

      <div class="col-1of3">
          <p class="sidenote-noborder">A Sankey diagram–inspired visualization designed to showcase the relationship between a user’s earnings and expenses. Users can switch views to organize their bills by due dates or by priority.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>BILL DETAIL</h2>
    <p class="col-1of1">While these bill details can be automatically determined by connecting to a user's bank activity, we ensured they could also be manually adjusted. Additionally, we provide relevant actions such as setting notifications before due dates or adding them to their calendar.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>PRODUCT SETUP</h2>
    <p class="col-1of1">As part of the deliverables, we also designed the onboarding experience for users to set up their bill reminders. By connecting to and analyzing their bank account, the system generates a list of recurring bills. Through machine learning, these bills are labeled by different priority levels (e.g., essential, important, secondary).</p>

    <h2>GOAL SETTING</h2>
    <p class="col-1of1">A unique part of the onboarding for bill reminders was goal setting. Working with the client, we identified a set of savings goals with a duration filter that are based on past data. The core idea is to help EarnIn users establish realistic goals that are within reach.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 quotes">"Our development team cannot keep up with the amount of creativity your team brought."</div>
    <p>The comment above came from one of the EarnIn executives. While the project was originally set to last three months, the client decided to extend the contract and continue our partnership. Since this was client work, we did not have access to their success metrics. That being said, I’ve discussed some hypothetical metrics that could be used to evaluate the success of our work.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>For <strong><a href="#navigation" class="intext-link">Navigation:</a></strong> To track the success of the proposed navigation design, we measure the usage rate—how often users access the Explore page—and the adoption rate of all features to determine if users are discovering new products.</li>
      <li>For <strong><a href="#onboarding" class="intext-link">Onboarding:</a></strong> The goal of the onboarding experience was to motivate users to engage with the app. Besides checking for basic usability (e.g., are users able to navigate through the flow without any issues?), we should also evaluate the time users spend on the overall onboarding experience. A satisfaction survey assessing users’ overall experience with the app could also provide valuable insights.</li>
      <li>For <strong><a href="#bill-reminder" class="intext-link">Bill Reminder:</a></strong> A straightforward way to measure success would be to track users’ saving rates after adopting the feature—are users able to pay their recurring bills on time? Are users able to accumulate savings? In cases where bank information isn’t available due to privacy concerns, tracking feature engagement rates and sending out voluntary surveys on the product’s helpfulness could also be effective.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="col-1of1">REFLECTION</h2>

    <p>While we managed to find ways to collect insights, I personally wished we could have recruited real EarnIn users for the most authentic feedback. The good news was that EarnIn had an internal rolling research protocol and user testing cycle—something I would strongly advocate leveraging if we were to redo the project. At the end of the day, nothing beats the real deal.</p>
