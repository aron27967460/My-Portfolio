        <p>
        I first joined Daylight at the peak of COVID-19. While it brought challenges, it also taught me resilience and adaptability as I transitioned to being a fully remote team member. Working at a design consultancy for the first time was a leap, but it allowed me to gain invaluable experience that I would like to share through the lens of my project experiences:</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 top-margin-2">
        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
        <h3>Uncovering Lighting Trends in Cars in China</h3>
        <p>Successful designs excel at being human-centered. At Daylight, this is the foundational principle for every project—whether it involves recruiting the right participants for research, conducting immersive home visits, or performing ad-hoc user testing. We always find creative ways to empathize with the people we’re designing for.</p>

        <p>During my project with an automotive components manufacturer, the client aimed to understand market needs for lighting in cars in China. To uncover the most genuine insights, our team devised an extensive research plan in Shanghai that included studying Chinese EV brands, interviewing customers with unique lighting needs, attending inspirational outings such as TeamLab, and consulting relevant experts from other fields. As a team, we embraced human-centered design and practiced that principle in the field. After cycles of an iterative process, the result was several one-of-a-kind concepts tailored to our client’s brand and the technology they possessed.</p>

        <h2 class="col-1of1">UX · DESIGN SYSTEM</h2>
        <h3>Reducing Burnout Among Housing Specialists</h3>
        <p>When solving a problem, there are always multiple layers of underlying causes, making it even more important to listen to everyone involved in the process. At Daylight, we had the advantage of being a third-party consultant, enabling us to better understand the situation by considering both our clients and their intended audiences.</p>

        <p>When initially working with the Santa Clara County Housing Authority (SCCHA) to address the public housing burden for tenants, Daylight and two other trusted partners came together to create <a class="intext-link2" style="display:inline-block;" target="_blank" href="https://www.scchousingauthority.org/section-8/for-participants/existing-tenants/tenant-portal/">Tenant Portal</a>—a digital tool that allowed people to manage their housing information and documents online. This tool proved highly helpful during the COVID-19 period. However, we also realized part of the issue stemmed from the excessive workload and burnout experienced by housing specialists.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="top-margin-4">As we continued to improve Tenant Portal, we also sought to streamline SCCHA’s internal administrative processes. We spent time talking to various housing program specialists and assistants, studying their operating manuals, and mapping out each of their processes. We created Autumn—a custom design system dedicated to SCCHA—to better facilitate the transition of their existing workflows into the digital world. Through feedback sessions with the intended users, we developed various workflows outlining all the individual steps, from using the platform we created to leveraging other tools such as email and government-regulated software. We delivered designs that helped specialists manage and stay on top of their workloads.</p>

        <h3>Improving Range Confidence for EV Customers</h2>
        <p>Working in a consulting environment requires great adaptability to chaos and changes. Things rarely go according to plan. With my expertise in UX/UI design, I often served as a rapid response force for other ongoing projects at Daylight, contributing additional design output.</p>

        <p>During a project aimed at improving customer range confidence in electric vehicles, I joined midway to create mid-fidelity concepts using the client’s design system. Despite having limited time and knowledge of a car’s infotainment system, I helped create interface mockups that met our standards and the project's goals. Although I wasn’t a core project member, it was satisfying to see how my efforts contributed to the team’s success.</p>

        <h2 class="col-1of1">UX · PROJECT MANAGEMENT</h2>
        <h3>Rediscovering App Value for Home Appliance Owners</h3>
        <p>As previously described, working as a consultant requires flexibility. Sometimes, it means taking on roles you may not be familiar with.</p>

        <p>While working with a home appliance client, Daylight was tasked with improving user engagement with their app. Although I originally joined as an individual contributor, I eventually assumed the role of project manager due to shifting resources. Throughout the project, I managed the sprint timeline, conducted user interviews, created a mock design system, and organized presentations to update the clients while fully participating in design execution.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="top-margin-4">By speaking to real appliance owners and understanding our client’s app, we delivered a set of feature concepts tailored to individual home appliances. For example, we learned that a washer has many downloadable cycles that could benefit users’ laundry needs, but the accessibility and experience of the cycle list were daunting and often too cumbersome for users to explore. To address this, we revamped the device page to simulate a physical dial experience. Additionally, we simplified the cycle list by prioritizing popular cycles and recommending cycles based on user routines. These and other concepts developed during the sprints led to several long-term projects with the client.</p>

        <h2 class="col-1of1">UX · PROTOTYPING</h2>
        <h3>Elevating the Financial Management Experience</h3>
        <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of working as a consultant is the opportunity to collaborate with clients from various industries. This diversity requires us to quickly learn and adapt, but at same time, we got to leverage our outsider perspective to explore novel ideas and challenge our creative boundaries.</p>

        <p>While working with a financial services company, we needed to understand Earned Wage Access (EWA), as well as the functionality of their app, their design system, and the ecosystem in which they operated. Despite a rapid schedule of sprints, we managed to deliver innovative, high-fidelity designs with precision. We achieved this by exploring an abundance of ideas.</p>

          <p class="bottomnote-center">To achieve the best results, we often explore a wide range of ideas.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="top-margin-4">
          During a sprint aimed at developing UI concepts to help customers better manage their finances, we created various visualizations to represent a customer's financial state by showcasing their recurring earnings and expenses. Considering usability factors such as spending categories, time spanning past and future, and goal setting, we worked with our client to down-select these exploratory concepts while retaining their novelty (due to our client agreement, I cannot show the final option we selected). Our craftsmanship and attention to detail led to great client satisfaction, resulting in an extended contract and continued partnership.</p>

      <p>
        While I joined Daylight with a specialized background in UX/UI design, I stepped out of my comfort zone and explored other roles such as research, project management, and client relations. Each position taught me how to create impact in ways beyond my typical design work. Additionally, I learned how different types of clients and projects could produce a variety of outcomes. Whether it was a grand product concept or a subtle UX improvement, opportunities to make a difference never ceased to exist. These experiences would not have been possible without practicing as a full-stack UX designer at a consultancy like Daylight. Being a Daylighter is an experience I will cherish for years to come.
