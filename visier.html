        <p>After meeting with the UX design lead, a visual designer, and three engineers, a brief was formulated with a list of UI components to be made.

My mentor and I hosted a weekly meeting with the rest of the team to discuss and update on missing components.</p>
        <p>For deliverables, net new components were uploaded from Sketch to Zeplin and shared with the responsible engineers. I’d also made a <a class="intext-link" href="files/VISIER/What-if-visual-design.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> consisting of all the UI elements used for the feature; including different interactive states and responsive sizing.</p>

      <div class="col-1of1 container">
        <p>Despite What-if being a powerful tool for workforce planning and management, it comes with certain limitations. For instance, when the assumption is on a time that is not contained in the chart. The assumption becomes ‘not applied.’ For this purpose, a visual treatment for these “Not Applied” state is vital in informing the users of which context token is, in fact, affecting the chart and which one is not. In the current experience, Visier has many UI inconsistencies (colour, spacing, usage...etc.). This was caused by <strong>1)</strong> designers providing visual spec that was not aligned/off from the style guide, <strong>2)</strong> developers coded the UI that was not up to spec or <strong>3)</strong> transitional issue from the old platform to the new one — Visier People.
        </p>
        <p>
        To effectively solve the issue, a development for a design system is essential. For this assignment, I’d conducted a thorough interface audit on the current product experience, primarily focusing on the button usage. From synthesizing with secondary research, I’d outlined on how Visier could approach and design using variations of buttons.

  <!-- FINAL THOUGHT -->
  <section class="container project-body top-margin-3">
    <h1 class="col-1of1" id="final-thought"><strong>FINAL THOUGHT</strong></h1>
    <p>One of the most important lessons I learned at Visier is the importance of communication. For each assignment, I collaborated with many talented individuals with each of them having a diverse background. Everyone has different approaches to work and were enthusiastic about sharing their expertise and knowledge to the project. With a team dynamic that was constantly changing, coordination between the team members became essential to maintain performance and efficiency. When running into obstacles to innovate, instead of tunnelling myself into a loophole, I learned to reach out to my colleagues and my mentors for help. To my delight, collaboration not only sparkled inspiration, but it also helped reassuring project quality. As a result, I have now embraced co-creation as part of my working process regardless of different stages of design.</p>
