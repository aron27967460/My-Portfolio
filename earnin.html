  <section class="container project-body" id="intro">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of working as a consultant is the opportunity to collaborate with clients from various industries. This diversity requires us to quickly learn and adapt, but at the same time, we got to leverage our outsider perspective to explore novel ideas and challenge our creative boundaries.</p>

    <p>While working with our client from the financial services, we needed to understand concept of Earned Wage Access (EWA), as well as the functionality of their mobile app, the design system, and the ecosystem in which they operated in. Despite a rapid schedule of sprints, we managed to deliver innovative, high-fidelity designs with precision. We achieved this by exploring an abundance of ideas and rapid prototyping.</p>

    <h1>Navigation and Explore</h1>
    <p class="col-1of1">As EarnIn continues to grow, more products are destined to come. With the ever-expanding list of features, EarnIn would like to re-think their navigation and discovery with the goal of simplified yet delightful cross-selling experience.</p>

    <h1>Onboarding</h1>
    <p class="col-1of1">While functionality is important, EarnIn believes that a compelling user experience creates a long lasting relationship with the customers. The revamp of the onboarding experience was part of the initiative in making that vision come true.</p>

      <h2 class="col-1of1">INTERACTIVE INTRO</h2>
      <p class="col-1of1">From our ad-hoc user test, we learned that videos were the most engaging methods. However, the experience should be brief and short (e,g, instagram’s stories as example). Users should also be in formed on how long the experience may be and have control to skip or not.</p>

    <h1>Bill Reminder</h1>
    <p>From one of the sprints, the challenge we were tasked with is to create a customer's financial managing experience and help them better manage their finances.

      </div>
    </div> -->

    <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p class="col-1of1">From the client, we learned that customers often have a certain amount of recurring earnings and expenses that can be projected. Our goal was to visualize this information and showcase how their live income could cover their expenses due in the upcoming weeks. We aimed to create an interface that can communicate the relationship between these entities and their associated information. In addition, we recognized that not all bills have the same priority level, so we introduced another ordering mechanism that allows users to label their bills and see how prioritized bills are being covered compared to covering them by due dates.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>BILL DETAIL</h2>
    <p class="col-1of1">While these bill details can be automatically determined by connecting to user's bank activity, we ensured they could also be manually adjusted. On top of that, we provide relevant actions such as setting notification before due dates or add to their calendar.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 container image-inbetween-text">

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>PRODUCT SETUP</h2>
    <p class="col-1of1">As part of the deliverables, we also designed the onboarding experience for users to set up their bill reminder. By connecting and analyzing their bank account, a list of recurring bills will populate. Through machine learning, these bills will be labelled into different priority (e.g., essential, important, secondary).</p>

    <h2>GOAL SETTING</h2>
    <p class="col-1of1">A unique part of the onboarding for bill reminder was goal setting. Working with the client, we identified a set of saving goals with a duration filter that's based on past data. The core idea is to help EarnIn users to establish a realistic goal within reach.</p>

    <!-- <h2 class="col-1of1">INNOVATE WITH PRACTICALITY</h2>
    <p>While the examples above are self-made mockups, it is that same level of detail and prototyping proficiency that won our client over. On top of that, our team consistently demonstrated a willingness to think outside the box and challenge our creativity. Below are some concepts we explored during the sprint. While we ultimately decided to move away from these concepts, it was not without a relentless effort to push the boundaries of these designs before opting for other options.</p> -->

<section class="container project-body" id="impact">
    <h1>Impact</h1>
    <p>Over the course of project, we delivered several features and UX revamp. While the project was originally set to be 3 months, the client was extremely impressed with our performance and decided to extend the contract and continue our partnership. In fact, from one of the executives, he mentioned they "have to pause the collaboration because our development team can't keep with the amount of creativity you guys brought."</p>
