        <p>As of 2024, <a class="intext-link2" href="https://www.lendingtree.com/debt-consolidation/affording-bills-survey/#:~:text=Almost%20half%20of%20Americans%20have,31%25%20said%20rent%20or%20mortgage.">almost half of Americans reported having difficulty paying their bills.</a> This is why EarnIn aims to reimagine the way money moves, so every person can better meet their financial potential. As their platform continues to pioneer as one of the most popular tools for accessing people’s future earnings, they wanted to further elevate their in-app user experience. Daylight’s primary objective was to achieve that vision by exploring a variety of interaction patterns and product ideas. My role within the project was to explore and create these designs.</p>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="container project-body" id="process">
    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>In a world where many UI patterns have become standardized and common, EarnIn’s executives believe in the value of a user experience that is unique and delightful—a lesson learned from their signature “transfer out” feature (see example below). While their internal design team is phenomenal in their own right, EarnIn wanted us to look further outside the box. Building on this belief, for each bi-weekly sprint, our team was given a product area to explore ways to make the overall customer journey more memorable without reducing its usability.</p>

    <h2>APPROACH</h2>
    <p>One of the most fascinating aspects of working as a consultant is the opportunity to collaborate with clients from various industries. This diversity requires us to quickly learn and adapt, but at the same time, we get to leverage our outsider perspective to explore novel ideas and challenge our creative boundaries.</p>

    <p>While working with our client in financial services, we needed to understand the concept of Earned Wage Access (EWA), along with the functionality of their mobile app, design system, and operating ecosystem. Despite a fast-paced sprint schedule, we delivered innovative, high-fidelity designs with precision. We achieved this by leveraging a three-designer team, enabling broad exploration of ideas and deep refinement of promising concepts through rapid prototyping.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="bottomnote-center">To achieve the best results, we often explore a wide range of ideas.</p>
    </div>

    <p>For this project, despite the sprint schedule not being built for user testing, we still managed to conduct internal testing sessions with our colleagues. While they were not real users, these sessions gave us a brief sense of what worked and what didn’t. In addition, we regularly hosted review sessions with our client’s working team—including designers, developers, and researchers—to leverage their experience with EarnIn users.</p>

    <h1>Concluding Thought</h1>
    <h2 class="col-1of1">RESULT</h2>
    <div class="col-1of1 quotes">“Our development team cannot keep up with the amount of creativity your team brought.”</div>
    <p>The comment above came from one of the EarnIn executives. While the project was originally set to last three months, the client decided to extend the contract and continue our partnership. Since this was client work, we did not have access to their success metrics. That being said, I’ve discussed some hypothetical metrics in the protected content that could be used to evaluate the success of our work.
