        <h2 class="col-1of1">CONTRIBUTION</h2>
        <p>As the lead designer on the team, I developed and managed our design system from the ground up. By collaborating with third-party developers and SCCHA stakeholders, I designed an all-in-one product experience including a document digitizer/organizer, a client relationship management (CRM) tool, a task management tool, and a performance dashboard. Throughout the project, I also acted as an active researcher, conducting interviews and user testing sessions to discover user insights and refine our designs.</p>

    <h1 class="col-1of1">Process</h1>

    <div class="col-1of1 container">
        <p>When solving a problem, there are always multiple layers of underlying causes, making it even more important to listen to everyone involved in the process. At Daylight, we had the advantage of being a third-party consultant, enabling us to better understand the situation by considering both our clients and their intended audiences.</p>

        <h2 class="col-1of1">PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>When initially working with SCCHA to address the public housing burden for tenants, Daylight and two other trusted partners came together to create <a class="intext-link2" style="display:inline-block;" target="_blank" href="https://www.scchousingauthority.org/section-8/for-participants/existing-tenants/tenant-portal/">Tenant Portal</a>—a digital tool that allowed people to manage their housing information and documents online. While this tool proved highly helpful especially during the COVID-19 period, we realized part of the issue stemmed from the overwhelming workload and burnout experienced by housing specialists.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>As we continued to improve Tenant Portal, we sought to streamline SCCHA’s internal administrative processes. As part of the core team, I spent time talking to various housing specialists and assistants, studying their operating manuals, and mapping out each of their processes. Through this research, we discovered a lack of organization for requests and paper documents. As a result, we aimed to create a centralized task and document management system to help specialists stay on top of their workloads—an initiative we called Autumn.</p>

        <h2>AUTUMN DESIGN SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>From our research, we discovered more than 20 processes, which would require hundreds of screens to capture them all. That’s when we decided to create a custom design system, dedicated to Autumn, to ensure consistency across all designs and to better facilitate the transition of their existing workflows into the digital world. </p>

        </div>

        <h2>PAGE TEMPLATES</h2>
        <p>Below, is a snapshot of page templates I created to help streamline our design process. Throughout the project, we continued to iterate these templates based on the feedback from the specialists at SCCHA.</p>
        <div class="col-1of1 container center image-inbetween-text">

            <p class="bottomnote">For interfaces that we use repetitively throughout the workflows, templates are a great way to streamline our design process.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>CUSTOM COMPONENTS</h2>
        <p>A major aspect of having a design system is creating custom components that capture the essence of how people operate in the real world. For the people at SCCHA, this meant a dashboard experience capable of organizing and managing all the tenant requests assigned to them. This required us to understand key information releveant to these cases and how they should be grouped and ordered.</p>

        <p>From talking to the specialists, we learned that the type of transactions is the most important factor, followed by their individual urgency and due dates. From typography and iconography to visual hierarchy, I used these findings to refine my design and created custom ticket card and various dashboard templates with different grouping and ordering mechanisms.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>PROCESSING A CASE</h2>
        <p>Upon accessing an individual ticket, we recognized the importance of gathering all relevant information needed for caseworkers to perform their tasks. To achieve this, we incorporated a cloud-based system to store all documents and included tenant- and owner-related information from the government-regulated software, Elite, which our developer partner later gained access to. By centralizing everything in one place, we created an all-in-one page that empowered specialists and assistants to process requests without switching between multiple tools.</p>

        <div class="col-1of1 container image-inbetween-text">
          <div class="col-1of1 container">

          </div>
          <div class="col-1of1">
              <p class="bottomnote">Ticket Page serves as the all-in-one place where case workers could access relevant document and information to process the ticket.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 class="top-margin-3">USER FLOW & INTERACTIVE PROTOTYPES</h2>
        <div class="col-1of1 container over-img center image-inbetween-text">
            <img src="images/DAYLIGHT/user-flow-preview.png" alt="Preview of some of the user flows for Autumn" width="100%">
        </div>
        <p>Using the design system, we were able to create experiences that adapted to SCCHA's existing processes. By listening to all the stakeholders involved, our design considered each step, both within and outside the platform. From reassigning tickets among case workers to processing a denied request, we developed various user flows as well as interactive prototypes to demonstrate the experience but also ensure every step is in compliance to their prototcols.</p>

        <h2 class="col-1of1 container top-margin-3">WORKLOAD DISTRIBUTION</h2>
        <div class="col-1of1 quotes">"There is an unequal distributed of work. It’s unfortunate because... I can tell you we all want to help and we care about each other."</div>
        <p class="top-margin-4">From speaking with caseworkers and managers, we learned that there was an unequal caseload distribution among staff. While people wanted to help each other, there simply wasn’t a system to empower them to do so. Using Autumn, I explored a range of features to enable ticket collaboration among staff, such as out-of-office coverage, case sharing, and dashboard permission granting. The example below is an out-of-office coverage prototype designed in compliance with SCCHA's coverage protocol.</p>

        <p>There are multiple possibilities depending on the request details. By reviewing SCCHA's operational protocol, I created user flows that account for different outcomes.

        <!-- FINAL THOUGHT -->
        <section class="container project-body" id="final-thought">
          <h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
          <h2 class="col-1of1">MEASURING SUCCESS</h2>
          <p>The collaboration with SCCHA lasted for 11 months, resulting in an MTP (Most Testable Product) version of Autumn along with a set of MVP designs for the client. Due to shifting client priorities, the team was unable to test the system ourselves. That said, I'd like to highlight a few key metrics I originally planned to evaluate:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ticket Completion Rate:</strong> The number of tickets caseworkers successfully process compared to those who do not use Autumn. </li>
            <li><strong>Processing Time to Completion:</strong> The average time caseworkers take to complete a request compared to the previous system (excluding time spent waiting for documents from applicants). Combining with Ticket Complete Rate, these metrics evaluate the efficiency and basic usability of the system.</li>
            <li><strong>Reduction in Escalation Rate:</strong> To reassure tenants, SCCHA often escalates requests to team managers and/or directors. This metric measures whether the number of escalation decreases with the use of Autumn.</li>
            <li><strong>User Satisfaction:</strong> From specialists to supervisors, we want to gauge their thought on the ease of use, process clarity and their stress level of using the system. At the end of the day, our goal is to reduce reduce specilaists' burnout.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
          <p>Developing a new product takes time, especially when creating an all-in-one tool that includes a document digitizer/organizer, a client relationship management (CRM) tool, a task management system, and a performance dashboard. It took up to 11 months to develop an MTP version of the product (i.e., Proof of Concept)—a significant risk and investment for public government agencies.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the process, I would further break the product development into distinct segments, covering only the most critical use cases and testing with specialists as early as possible. The sooner we could begin testing, measuring key metrics, and evaluating potential impact, the more reassurance we could provide to the client. This approach might have allowed us to present more data-driven insights, potentially extending our collaboration with them.</p>

          <p>While the product was designed specifically for SCCHA, I believe its impact could extend far beyond. With homelessness and economic inequality continuing to rise, approximately 3,300 public housing authorities in the U.S., like SCCHA, could benefit from this all-in-one solution. For many families, receiving this assistance is the difference between having a home vs. living on the street. With Autumn, I envision a future where we empower specialists to deliver help to families in need in a timely and stress-free manner.</p>
