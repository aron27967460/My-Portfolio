  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="container project-body" id="intro">
    <h1 class="col-1of1">Introduction</h1>

    <div class="col-1of1 container">
        <p>When solving a problem, there are always multiple layers of underlying causes, making it even more important to listen to everyone involved in the process. At Daylight, we had the advantage of being a third-party consultant, enabling us to better understand the situation by considering both our clients and their intended audiences.</p>

        <h2 class="col-1of1">PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>When initially working with SCCHA to address the public housing burden for tenants, Daylight and two other trusted partners came together to create <a class="intext-link2" style="display:inline-block;" target="_blank" href="https://www.scchousingauthority.org/section-8/for-participants/existing-tenants/tenant-portal/">Tenant Portal</a>—a digital tool that allowed people to manage their housing information and documents online. While this tool proved highly helpful especially during the COVID-19 period, we realized part of the issue stemmed from the overwhelming workload and burnout experienced by housing specialists.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p>As we continued to improve Tenant Portal, we sought to streamline SCCHA’s internal administrative processes. We spent time talking to various housing specialists and assistants, studying their operating manuals, and mapping out each of their processes. Through this research, we discovered a lack of organization for requests and paper documents. As a result, we aimed to create a centralized task and document management system to help specialists stay on top of their workloads—an initiative we called Autumn</p>

        <h2>AUTUMN DESIGN SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>From our research, we discovered more than 20 processes, which would require hundreds of screens to capture them all. That’s when we decided to create a custom design system, dedicated to Autumn, to ensure consistency across all designs and to better facilitate the transition of their existing workflows into the digital world. </p>

            <p class="bottomnote">A custom design system I created to enable our team to build a consistent user experience for the different processes at SCCHA.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>PAGE TEMPLATES</h2>
        <p>Below, is a snapshot of page templates I created to help streamline our design process. Throughout the project, we continued to iterate these templates based on the feedbacks from the specialists at SCCHA.</p>

            <img src="images/DAYLIGHT/SCCHA-autumn-page-templates.png" alt="Page templates created using Autumn Design System" width="100%">
            <p class="bottomnote">For interface that we use repeatatively throughout the workflows, templates are a great way to streamline our design process.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>CUSTOM COMPONENTS</h2>
        <p>A major aspect of having a design system is creating custom components that capture the essence of how people operate in the real world. For the people at SCCHA, this meant a dashboard experience capable of organizing and managing all the tenant requests assigned to them. This required us to understand key information releveant to these cases and how they should be grouped and ordered.</p>

        <p>From talking to the specialists, we learned that the type of transactions is the most important factor, followed by their individual urgency and due dates. From typography and iconography to visual hierarchy, I used these findings to refine my design and created custom ticket card and various dashboard templates with different grouping and ordering mechanisms.</p>

        <h2>RAPID PROTOTYPING - DOCUMENT INTAKE</h2>
        <p>Below is a page template for SCCHA's office assistant to intake new documents. With multi-layered components, I enabled other designers to swap out content as needed and efficiently build their workflows.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>PROCESSING A CASE</h2>
        <p>Upon accessing an individual ticket, we knew it was key to gather all the relevant information needed for case workers to perform their tasks. To achieve this, we incorporated a cloud-based system to store all documents and access key data from the government-regulated software named Elite. By centralizing this information in one place, we created a Ticket Page that includes Ticket Details, Entity Info, and an Activity Log, empowering specialists and assistants to process requests without needing to switch back and forth between other tools.</p>

        <div class="col-1of1 container image-inbetween-text">

        <h2 class="top-margin-3">USER FLOW & INTREACTIVE PROTOTYPES</h2>

        </div>
        <p>Using Autumn, we were able to create experiences that adapted to SCCHA's existing processes. By listening to all the stakeholders involved, our design considered each step, both within and outside the platform. From reassigning tickets among case workers to processing a denied request, we developed various user flows as well as interactive prototypes to demonstrate the experience but also ensure every step is in compliance to their prototcols.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>IMPACT</h2>
          <p>Above was just a few examples. With the use of our design system, we were able to transform countless more of their workflows into the digital world. The collaboration with SCCHA lasted for 11 months. The result was a MTP (Most Testable Product) version of Autumn along with a set of MVP designs to the client.
