        <h2>On-Site Observation</h2>
        <p>The on-site observation allowed us to look at the working environment of A Rocha. Interestingly enough, although the farmland is in fact quite a vast place, with a small population, members of A Rocha prefer to have face-to-face interaction more than any other communication method.</p>

        <h2 class="green">OPPORTUNITY AND DESIGN FOCUS</h2>
        <p>Through research and data analysis, our team was particularly interested in the fact that, despite A Rocha owning a clear vision in growing and spreading its impact across the world, the current data storing and tracking system does not allow them to become into its ideal position. Therefore, we decided to take this opportunity and try to design a system that could potentially enable A Rocha's growth as an organization.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-2">
        <h2 class="green col-1of1">PROPOSED SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>We believed data storage and tracking offers much beyond than its technical functionality. That said, while we tried to design a digital tool allowing candidates to register and sign up to volunteer in a convenient, and meaningful manner, we also aimed to improve the connections between individual members of the A Rocha's community; whether it's volunteer-to-volunteer, volunteer-to-staff, or staff-to-staff. </p>

    <div class="col-1of1 container">
        <h2 class="green col-1of1">REGISTRATION</h2>
        <p>While retaining user's ability to sign up for one-time volunteer only, we wanted dedicated candidates to join A Rocha and become a permanent member of the community. Therefore, the extension was provided on A Rocha original website, which linked to our A Rocha Volunteer account tool. By having the users to sign up and select their field of interest and availability, it gives them a more convenient way to revisit and view more future opportunities that best accommodate their interests. Besides, the registration also empowers the internal staff to track volunteers' information in an organized structural manner.</p>
        <h2>Friction Point:</h2>
        <p> Initially, interested candidates would have to either fill up a form or email the administrator, then wait for the organization to reply to volunteer. This uncertain wait time may discourage these potential volunteers and eventually lose interest to further pursuing in completing the rest of the procedure. Our product is then aimed to give an immediate response to the users and continue their enthusiasm in volunteering.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-1">
        <h2 class="green col-1of1">PRE-VERIFIED STAGE</h2>
        <p>From our research, we learned that some specific prerequisites are needed so that interested candidates can officially and legally begin their journey of volunteering. We leveraged this insight and implemented a pre-verified status for each volunteer so that volunteers would be notified and informed of the requirement.</p>
        <h2>Friction Point:</h2>
        <p>From A Rocha's original working system, no formal structure informs the volunteers of any prerequisite. Users would have to browse and explore different pages from A Rocha's main website to discover the information; this could potentially lead to legal issues as well as unsafe behaviour when people begin to participate in volunteering. Our team redesigned the experience to make it a more linear mandatory process for each interested candidates who want to become volunteers at A Rocha.</p>

        <h2 class="green col-1of1">BROWSING AND SIGNING UP FOR OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
        <p>At A Rocha, there is a wide range of opportunities for potential volunteers. We emphasize on this strength and focus on creating a platform providing various ways of browsing; allowing the users to find the best volunteer opportunity that caters to their interest.</p>
        <h2>Friction Point:</h2>
        <p>While the main A Rocha website does provide users detailed information for volunteering, too many noises were generated before the segment which takes away the attention from the users; making finding opportunity overloading and much time-consume. Thus, our product minimizes all the noises and creates a clear visual hierarchy that gives A Rocha volunteers a convenient way to find a platform to browse and sign up to volunteer.</p>

        <h2 class="green col-1of1">VIEWING AND UPDATING PROFIES</h2>
        <p>Keeping track of data and changes had become a significant issue to A Rocha as the organization struggles to coordinate each volunteer. And by giving users a way to update their personal information, availability, and field of interest, A Rocha is empowered with the ability to adapt to any new changes from the users quickly.</p>
        <h2>Friction Point:</h2>
        <p>Initially, A Rocha solely relies on volunteers themselves to notify the administrator and the other internal staffing for any particular changes through email, phone calls, or in person. While the method does serve its purpose, miscommunication would often occur; causing a situation that's both sophisticating and frustrating for the volunteers and the business. So without altering the current system, our team adds another a way that is easy and error-free to make any changes.</p>

        <p>Leveraging from the insight we gained from our research, we also incorporate the administrator's perspective to empower her/him with the ability to coordinate volunteers based on upcoming events or interests. Also, the administrator could also find ideal candidates that are best suited with the organization's need and can print off information of each which synchronizes with the working culture of A Rocha where most of the employees prefer to have a face-to-face meeting without minimal technology.</p>

    <h1 class="col-1of1"><strong>FINAL THOUGHT</strong></h1>
    <p>Our proposed solution aims to provide A Rocha with the potential of expanding into a global scaled organization while retaining its active engagement with its volunteers. We recognize that data and information are undoubtedly the crucial keys for an organization to become globally successful. And A Rocha Volunteers empowers the company's members precisely that to allow them to keep track of data in an organized and efficient fashion.</p>
    <p>This project provided me with a unique opportunity and experience in design. The nature of the problem which requires a solution that accounts for two sides of stakeholders: the volunteers and the internal staffs. And this two-way system was challenging for me since I had to keep both parties in mind while designing the interfaces. Ultimately, I believe our product was able to carry out that aspect quite efficiently, and the project taught about the importance of taking consideration of any possible stakeholders.</p>
