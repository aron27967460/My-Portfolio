      <div class="col-2of3">
        <p>A Rocha Volunteers is an online account tool that facilitates dedicated candidates through a streamlined, meaningful registration and sign-up process. This tool helps them continually engage with volunteer opportunities, unlocking the organization’s future potential to grow into a global scale community. The project is developed as a case study throughout the course: IAT 333 Interaction Design Methods where students execute on different research methods and design a final solution for their selected client.</p>
        <h2 class="green">CHALLENGE</h2>
        <p>How might we help A Rocha to better keep track of its volunteers?</p>
        <h2 class="green">ROLE</h2>
        <p>As the UX/UI Designer on the team, I specialized in designing the user interface for our final product along with some other visual design such as posters and concept slides. I was also one of the primary executors in conducting various research methods with our participant group. Also, I’d redesigned the user interface, and interaction posts our final exhibition.</p>

        <h2>On-Site Observation</h2>
        <p>The on-site observation allowed us to look at the working environment of A Rocha. Interestingly enough, although the farmland is in fact quite a vast place, with a small population, members of A Rocha prefer to have face-to-face interaction more than any other communication method.</p>

        <p>We sat down with a total of 4 members with each of them holding an essential role at A Rocha such as VP, administrator, and conservation science team leader.

      <p>We invited some of the staffs as well as volunteer to take parts in our workshop. The workshop mainly aimed to gain more information on individuals’ values that align with the organization’s values. Also, we also collaborated with the members to map out a brief stakeholder map on how volunteers are being coordinated and managed.</p>

        <p>We came up with three different personas based on the information we’d collected from the organization so far. Then we chose one as our designated target audience to design for - the administrator.</p>

        <h2 class="green">OPPORTUNITY AND DESIGN FOCUS</h2>
        <p>Through research and data analysis, our team was particularly interested in the fact that, despite A Rocha owning a clear vision in growing and spreading its impact across the world, the current data storing and tracking system does not allow them to become into its ideal position. Therefore, we decided to take this opportunity and try to design a system that could potentially enable A Rocha's growth as an organization.</p>

    <div class="col-1of1 container top-margin-2">
        <h2 class="green col-1of1">PROPOSED SOLUTION</h2>
        <p>We believed data storage and tracking offers much beyond than its technical functionality. That said, while we tried to design a digital tool allowing candidates to register and sign up to volunteer in a convenient, and meaningful manner, we also aimed to improve the connections between individual members of the A Rocha's community; whether it's volunteer-to-volunteer, volunteer-to-staff, or staff-to-staff. </p>

    <h1 class="col-1of1" id="project-overview"><strong>FINAL THOUGHT</strong></h1>
    <p>Our proposed solution aims to provide A Rocha with the potential of expanding into a global scaled organization while retaining its active engagement with its volunteers. We recognize that data and information are undoubtedly the crucial keys for an organization to become globally successful. And A Rocha Volunteers empowers the company's members precisely that to allow them to keep track of data in an organized and efficient fashion.</p>
    <p>This project provided me with a unique opportunity and experience in design. The nature of the problem which requires a solution that accounts for two sides of stakeholders: the volunteers and the internal staffs. And this two-way system was challenging for me since I had to keep both parties in mind while designing the interfaces. Ultimately, I believe our product was able to carry out that aspect quite efficiently, and the project taught about the importance of taking consideration of any possible stakeholders.</p>
