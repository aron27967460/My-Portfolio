        <p>Google Local Live is an add-on feature on Google Map that aims to empower small local restaurants to entice new potential customers in a cost-free, proactive manner. It is a project that was inspired by my personal experience of witnessing local enterprises struggle to maintain public engagement with their customers. Therefore, I want to find a way to help resolving this situation.

        <h2>THE STORY</h2>
        <p>
        I remembered the time when my aunt and uncle opened their restaurant in the East Vancouver. They made such delicious Chinese dishes with great portion that are certainly worth the one’s money. I remembered I would just be sitting on the side enjoying my favourite dish - mapo tofu on rice while chatting with my family. It was one of the most memorable time of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
        The memory didn’t last for long. After a couple years, my aunt and uncle had to close down the restaurant partially due to the lack of profit. That was when I realize how hard it is for a small local business to sustain the long-term challenge of survival.
      </p>

        <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
        <p>
          In Canada, small businesses account for the majority of the domestic economy. According to Statistics Canada, there are around 1.17 million employer businesses within the nation. <strong>“Of these, 1.14 million (97.9 percent) businesses [are] small businesses,” and 78,394 (6.9%) of them lie within the accommodation and food services.</strong> (June 2016) Unfortunately, despite having the highest new firm birth rate, <strong>the sector of accommodation and food services also shows the lowest survival rate of having only 31% of the businesses sustaining over a 10 years time span.</strong> This information to me indicates a critical issue of small food enterprises having the struggle to maintain their businesses overtime.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look further into the case of my family business history. In my opinion, although having great products, services and certain amount of loyal customers, my aunt and uncle’s restaurant simply did not have the capability to attract new customers in order to expand the customer's group size and maintain that profitability for their business. This could be caused by different factors such as the limited financial support, or not having enough human resource to manage this much needed businesses-to-customer relationship. Ultimately, this led to the failure to sustain their businesses and so as many other small local firms. This brought me to ask, <strong>why isn't there a way to allow these businesses to effectively raise customer awareness?</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-1of1 top-margin-4">
        <h2>Secondary Research</h2>
        <p>I started to explore different tools and medium that help businesses to attract new customers. While news platforms and publishers (i.e. Daily Hive, and blogTO)could serve the job, most of them come with certain cost and do not provide long-term sustainability. In addition, I also looked into SNS such as Facebook, Instagram, and twitter. Although these platforms are cost-free and possess the ability to notify subscribers about the company’s news which help to retain existing customers, they genuinely do not empower businesses in reaching out to new customers. Lastly, while search engines like Google and service providers such as Yelp allow users to discover new enterprises, I feel that these tools lack the proactive aspect of allowing business owners to connect with the customers themselves.</p>

        <p>Overall, through synthesizing my research, I’d came to wonder, <strong>how might we enable small local businesses to effectively engage with potential new consumers in a cost-free, proactive manner?</strong></p>
